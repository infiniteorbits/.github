# Infinite Orbits

Infinite Orbits is an in-orbit service provider developping satellite life extension and satellite inspection services. We develop state-of-the-art algorithms to ensure safe and effective space rendezvous and docking in GEO.

We design and operate two classes of satellite:
* Orbit Guard: a small sat with the ability to perform Space Situational Awareness and Satellite Inspection. Orbit Guard-1 was launched aboard a Falcon Heavy in May 2023 with Orbit Guard-2 and Orbit Guard-3 planned for 2024 and 2025 respectively.
* Endurance: a satellite designed to rendezvous and dock on GEO telecom satellites to provide Life Extension, Slot transfer and Inclination Correction.
